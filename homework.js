//    Homework will help you practice loops, arrays, objects, and functions.
// Create a folder inside the code folder called homework.
// Inside of the homework folder, create a file named day-two.js and do these:
// 1. Write a function that adds two numbers together
// 2. Create a function that returns the number of true values there are in an array.
// const testArray = [ true, false, false, true, false, false, false, true, true, true, false ]
// 3. Write a function that receives a car object as an argument and outputs the cars make and model.
// 4. Write a function to get the first element in an array.
